# Malware-Images

This project contains the basic python scripts needed to create a malware images dataset.

## Dependencies

Following packages are required to run the scripts in this project:

- pyzipper
- numpy
- matplotlib
- opencv-python

to install all dependencies at once run the following command:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Download Malware-Samples

All malware-samples are downloaded from [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/). Each `csv` file in `/sha256` contains all sha256-values of the files from each malware-family that is contained in the dataset.  

In order to download open a terminal in `/download` and execute the following command:  
`python3 bazaar_download.py -s <malware-family>.csv`  

After completing the download you can run the `unpack.py` which will unpack and delete all zip files.

## Conversion

To run the conversion you have to specify the base path of the downloaded exe-files in the `conversion_data.py`.  
After that you can either execute the `run_full_conversion.py` which will run the other scripts in the folder or run them one by one.

The generated files will be stored in a separate folders specified in the `conversion_data.py`.
